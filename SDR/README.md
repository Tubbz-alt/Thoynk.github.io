Thoynk.AI is about radically collaborative AI ... SDR is about the physics of people. Of course, technical aptitude and basic background are necessary to follow any of the debate what shapes the policy on communication technologies we use. Most of us would benefit from understanding a lot more about how our common wireless internetworked devices work, whose interests are served by the technological policy and why many of those interests benefit immensely from uninformed users. We should understand a bit about [radio spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum) or the parts of the electromagnetic spectrum from 3 Hz to 3000 GHz (3 THz) that are of greater significance for [radiocommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocommunication_service) uses like [Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN) with [Wi-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11), [Wireless Personal Area Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15) such as [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth) or [Zigbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigbee), as well as mobile telephony such as [GSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM) and (CDMA)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-division_multiple_access] used in cellular services.

Developing a working knowledge of software defined radio probably starts with some basic background reading in [RF and Digital Signal Processing for Software-Defined Radio] (https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/rf-and-digital/9780750682107/). After that, experimentation with [GNRradio](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Main_Page) and following [communities of people who are experimenting RTL-SDR](https://www.reddit.com/r/RTLSDR/) using [really inexpensive RTL2832U devices such as DVB-T tv tuner dongles and even entry-level HAM radios](http://a.co/5tOVLFk) is enlightening, but [without a HAM license] it's still mostly a matter of receiving signals. Getting into more interesting, slightly more expensive such as such as [HackRF](https://github.com/mossmann/hackrf/wiki/HackRF-One) or [LimeSDR](https://www.crowdsupply.com/lime-micro/limesdr/updates) allows for really basic transmitting and more experimentation. This is kind of background that is necessary in order to go beyond following and asking questions [which is important enough] to be able to offer meaningful contributions to conversations with others who share an interest in software defined radio. Ultimately, Learning about software defined radio is highly collaborative because the physics of software defined radio really boils down to the physics of people.

The physics of people ultimately drives software development, what things are used for and whether the use will ever matter to anyone. Programmability, middleware and open application programmable interfaces (APIs) will be key factors necessary for the success of future IoT platforms. Even if the devices are not human, the relevant use cases for IoT ultimately are. The basic IoT devices or sensors are designed to run efficiently in a small form factor with very low power requirements and they generate very specific and predictable message traffic which can be treated very differently, much more efficiently and much more securely than human-generated traffic ... malicious hackers are not going to have that much interest in exploiting what the device itself is transmitting, although they will care about the purpose the device is being used for and they may try to wreck or impersonate a device to accomplish an attack on a human system ... so security of IoT ultimately boils down to the physics of people.
