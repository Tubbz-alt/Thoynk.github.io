Thoynk.AI is about radically collaborative AI ... a radically simpler, more robust, more reliable, [more open and antifragile internet infrstructure](https://medium.com/@getongab/we-are-at-war-for-a-free-and-open-internet-426629fba4bf) for a much more highly-distributed efficient collaborative design and data analysis framework.

There are different inspirations for Thoynk, but some are especially worth mentioning. If you understand just one thing from [ZeroMQ](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all), please understand this:

*Programming is science dressed up as art because most of us don't understand the physics of software and it's rarely, if ever, taught. The physics of software is not algorithms, data structures, languages and abstractions. These are just tools we make, use, throw away. **The real physics of software is the physics of people** *â€” specifically, our limitations when it comes to complexity, and our desire to work together to solve large problems in pieces ... while the Internet offers the potential of massively connected code* [which might help crowds of people work more efficiently on a variety of different problems, other than just software]*, the reality is that this is out of reach for most of us, and so larger interesting problems remain unsolved because there is no way to connect the code, and thus no way to connect the brains that could work together to solve these problems..*
